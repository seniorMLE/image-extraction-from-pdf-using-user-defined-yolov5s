Create a python script for document layout analysis and extraction
Convert pdf documents in a folder to png images with 95dpi (documentname _pagenumber.png)
Run yolov5s (small) pretrained object detection model in tensorflow over the images
Yolov5s_name_name.pt weights model will be taken from a user specified directory
Extract the recognized objects inside the bounding box above a user defined confidence threshold (0.1) as images in native resolution as png
Save the images in a new directory within the document directory with the name: detectionconfidence_imagenumber_documentname_pagenumber.png
Create a richly annotated python script that is easy to read and run for a novice
Make variables for dpi values (pdf2image library)

how to add user defined dataset in 1000pdf
it is freeware MIT license if you want you can use it

Important is following as
model = torch.hub.load('yolov5', 'custom', path=weight_path, source='local')

first git clone yolov5s and weight_path is user defined weight
